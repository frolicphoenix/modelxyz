# Modelxyz

Modelxyz is a 3D model viewer web application that allows users to upload and interact with 3D models directly in their browser. This project leverages WebGL and Three.js to provide a seamless and interactive experience for visualizing and manipulating 3D assets.

## Features

- **3D Model Viewing:** Upload and view 3D models in various formats (e.g., OBJ, GLTF, FBX).
- **Interactive Controls:** Rotate, zoom, and pan the models for a detailed view.
- **Real-time Rendering:** Enjoy smooth and responsive rendering using WebGL and Three.js.
- **Customizable Environment:** Adjust the lighting, background, and camera settings to enhance the viewing experience.

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/modelxyz.git
   cd modelxyz
   \`\`\`

2. **Install dependencies:**

   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. **Start the development server:**

   \`\`\`bash
